  Did you know that Gartner
  estimated over $17B of cloud computing costs are wasted yearly, mainly by
  using suboptimal configurations? <br/>
  Vantage.sh maintains a costs leaderboard that shows EC2 and EBS are in the top positions. As per
  their stats 85% of EBS volumes (the storage used by every single running EC2 instance) are from previous generations and could be optimized with a small harmless configuration change to cost up to 20% less and offer increased performance. <br/>
  On the EC2 side, from our experience the majority of AutoScaling groups could also be safely converted to EC2 Spot instances for up to 90% cost savings. <br/> <br/>
  CloudUtil offers a set of utilities designed to automatically tackle this waste with no required configuration changes, generating significant cost savings with minimal effort.
