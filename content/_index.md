  <a href="https://www.business2community.com/cloud-computing/wasted-cloud-spend-to-exceed-17-6-billion-in-2020-fueled-by-cloud-computing-growth-02292542">over $17B of cloud computing waste</a> in 2020, much of it by
  using suboptimal configurations, and that
  Vantage's AWS Cost Leaderboard shows <a href="https://leaderboard.vantage.sh/"> EC2 and EBS are among the largest cost drivers</a>? <br/>

  On the EC2 side, the majority of AutoScaling groups are fault tolerant enough to be safely converted to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot instances</a>, for up to 90% cost savings. <br/>

  When it comes to EBS volumes, Vantage also announced that about 85% of EBS volumes (the block storage used by every single running EC2 instance) are from previous generations and <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/blog/ebs-gp2-to-gp3-cost-savings">could be optimized to cost up to 20% less and offer increased performance</a> with a small and harmless configuration change. <br/>
